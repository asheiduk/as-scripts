git-roboedit:

  - First commit in repo does not detect branch name properly and
    uses "HEAD".

svn-am:

  - Exit code of "svn patch" does not indicate rejected hunks.
  
  - git's binary diff format is not rejected but files are empty.

  - Renames are not handled properly. (Did not check "copy")
