		Retrieve these informations about the creation of the given branch:

		- The revision which created the branch. This revision contains the copy

		- The source path of the branch.
		
		- The revision which is mentioned in the "A \$BRANCH (from \$SOURCE:\$REV)"
		  line in svn log. This is NOT the revision of the last change in the source 
		  but *usually* the revision just before the commit creating the branch.
		
		- The revision of the last change in the source path. This is the really
