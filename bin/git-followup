# git followup <branch>

# Update a local branch (not currently checked out) to the remote
# tracking branch. Will fail if the branch cannot be fast-forwarded.
#
# So it's basically the same as
#
#    git checkout $branch
#    git pull --ff-only
#    git checkout -
#
# but does not touch the worktree.
