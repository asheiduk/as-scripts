git-followup: Skip *all* branches used in *any* worktree, not just
    current branch in in current worktree. Add "-w" option to
    automatically do a pull for these branches in the right worktree.

git-followup: Add "branch.$BRANCH.followup" configuration variable.
    Supported values should be "force" to automatically prepend "+" to
    the branch name (works with and without "-a") and "no/false" to skip
    this branch when using "-a".
